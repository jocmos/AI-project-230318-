# Project Title

Buildig Management System for saving cost.

## Summary

Entrusting the management of the interior (referred to as space) of an office or commercial building.

## Background

- Space management is still being done by humans (high cost, low efficiency) 
- Because people who are responsible for the building management (such as real estate developers, contractors, interior design companies, and building management teams) do not give much consideration to the possibility of technology due to its nature of no interest. 
- This results in wasted energy being used, such as air conditioning, lighting, etc. being operated even when there are no people present.

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1: Labor cost is high
* problem 2: Data is not collected or analyzed
* problem 3: Tedious job is often mismanaged
* problem 4: Unnecessary electricity or heat are being wasted.

## How is it used?


- Automatic settings for building lighting, air conditioning, background music, etc.
- Security functions such as access control are also set automatically, for example, by setting opening and closing times for specific areas during specific times.
- Authorized individuals only need to register, and their level of access to the space is determined according to the permission system.
- Unnecessary functions are removed and suggested automatically. If a function has never been used, it may be better to not have it at all (for example, emergency services).


## Data sources and AI methods
People's path, time of bulding usage, Registration data, etc.


## Challenges
Registration Process

## What next?
If the usefulness, cost savings of management, and increase in sales are proven, it can develop even further through greater demand.
